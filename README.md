### Hello World 🌎⚽


[Visit My Website](https://coheneyal.com)

I'm Eyal, Software Engineer from Tel Aviv. I also study psychology at the Open University Of Israel.
Right now I'm doing consulting for various companies.
I love teaching people about code, and building my own products.

🔭 I use `.js` mainly, and I really love React, React Native, and Node.js.

📕 I'm using AWS and Vercel to deploy my products.

📽️ I lately wrote an [hebrew book teaching React Native](https://gumroad.com/l/zero-to-app-react-native/), built an [app that helps Students in my university](https://kvozut.co.il), and the [React Native Israeli Job Board](reactnative.co.il).

⚽ I love to play, watch, talk and everything else about Football (if you play Football Manager, ping me ASAP).

💬 I'm also [writing a blog](https://coheneyal.com) at my own website.

📬 I'm always available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coheneyal4), send me a message there too!

🍕 Fun Fact: I once built Pizza Hut Israeli website.
